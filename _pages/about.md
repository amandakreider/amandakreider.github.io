## About Me

I'm a health economist and assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. I hold a PhD in Health Policy and Economics from Harvard University (2021). My research examines how public policy impacts healthcare access, with a focus on outcomes for older adults, people living in poverty, and people with disabilities. I'm particularly interested in the economics of long-term care, Medicaid, and Medicare.
