## About Me

I'm a health economist and an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh. My research examines how US public policy impacts people from historically marginalized groups, including those living in poverty, experiencing chronic illness or disability, or exposed to the criminal legal system. I'm particularly interested in the economics of public health insurance programs, long-term care, immigration, and mental health care. Through my research, I hope to contribute to a more equitable and accessible health care system.
