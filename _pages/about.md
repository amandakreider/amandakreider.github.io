## Bio

Amanda Kreider is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. She studies the economics of health insurance markets with a focus on public health insurance programs. Her research interests include Medicaid, long-term care, safety net policies, and mental health care. She is especially interested in factors affecting health care access and coverage for low-income individuals and families, and people with chronic and mental health conditions.  

Dr. Kreider received her PhD in health policy and economics from Harvard University in November 2021, where her dissertation research demonstrated how economic incentives faced by Medicaid managed care plans affect access to specialty care in the Medicaid program. While in graduate school, she held a pre-doctoral fellowship in aging & health economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Prior to graduate school, she worked as a research associate at PolicyLab at The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia. ***She expects to be on the job market in Fall 2023.***
