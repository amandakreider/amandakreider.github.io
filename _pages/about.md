## About Me

I'm a health economist and a postdoctoral fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. My research examines how US public policy impacts people marginalized by society, including those living in poverty, experiencing chronic illness or disability, or exposed to the criminal legal system. I'm particularly interested in the economics of health insurance (especially Medicaid), long-term care, immigration, and mental health care. Through my research, I hope to contribute to a more equitable and accessible health care system.

I completed my PhD in health policy and economics at Harvard University in November 2021. My dissertation demonstrated how economic incentives faced by private Medicaid plans impact access to specialty care for Medicaid enrollees. While in graduate school, I held a pre-doctoral fellowship in aging & health economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research associate at PolicyLab at The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia. When I'm not working, I'm in the kitchen cooking up something delicious, tending to my window boxes, watching movies, managing my fantasy basketball team, [coding](https://amandakreider.github.io/side-projects/) for fun, practicing yoga and/or passionately cheering on the Sixers. 

***I expect to be on the job market in Fall 2023.*** You can check out my latest working paper [here](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30719){:target="\_blank"}!
