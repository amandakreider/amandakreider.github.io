## About Me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. I study the economics of health insurance markets, with a focus on public health insurance programs. My research interests include Medicaid, long-term care, safety net policies, and mental health care. I am especially interested in factors affecting health care access and coverage for low-income individuals and families and people with chronic and mental health conditions.  

I received my PhD in health policy and economics from Harvard University in November 2021, where my dissertation demonstrated how economic incentives faced by Medicaid managed care plans affect access to specialty care in the Medicaid program. While in graduate school, I held a pre-doctoral fellowship in aging & health economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a research associate at PolicyLab at The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia. ***I expect to be on the job market in Fall 2023.***
