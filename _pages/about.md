## About Me

I'm a health economist and a postdoctoral fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. My research examines how US public policy impacts people from historically marginalized groups, including those living in poverty, experiencing chronic illness or disability, or exposed to the criminal legal system. I'm particularly interested in the economics of public health insurance programs, long-term care, immigration, and mental health care. Through my research, I hope to contribute to a more equitable and accessible health care system.

I completed my PhD in health policy and economics at Harvard University in November 2021. My [dissertation](https://amandakreider.github.io/dissertation/) demonstrated how Medicaid managed care plans' economic incentives influence access to specialty care for enrollees. While in graduate school, I held a fellowship in aging & health economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research associate at PolicyLab at The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia. When I'm not working, you can find me lifting weights, cooking up something delicious, tending to my window boxes, watching movies, managing my fantasy basketball team, [coding](https://amandakreider.github.io/side-projects/) for fun, practicing yoga, or passionately cheering on the Sixers and the Phillies. 

***I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market.*** You can check out my CV [here](https://amandakreider.github.io/files/kreider_cv.pdf){:target="\_blank"}!
