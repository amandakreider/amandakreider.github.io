The scripts in my **US News Hospital Rankings** project scrape the <a target="_blank" href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals">US News & World Report website</a> for hospital rankings by city and output the data as .csv files. I've written code for Philly and NYC; this code can easily be modified to generate data for other cities.
