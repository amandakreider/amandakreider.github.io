The Python scripts in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/amandakreider/US-News-Hospital-Rankings">US News Hospital Rankings project</a> scrape the <a target="_blank" href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals">US News & World Report website</a> for hospital rankings by place and specialty and output the data as .csv files. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/amandakreider/US-News-Hospital-Rankings/tree/main/scripts">scripts</a> are easily modifiable to generate data for any combination of specialty and place in the United States.
